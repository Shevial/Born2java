## About Java and Object-Oriented Programming

Java is a versatile and widely-used programming language, known for its platform independence and robust ecosystem. It follows the principles of Object-Oriented Programming, a paradigm that organizes software design around objects, which combine data (attributes) and behaviors (methods). Key principles of OOP include:

- **Encapsulation**: Bundling data and methods within objects to restrict direct access.
- **Inheritance**: Creating new classes based on existing ones to promote code reuse.
- **Polymorphism**: Designing methods to perform differently based on context.
- **Abstraction**: Simplifying complex systems by modeling essential features.

This repository leverages these principles to solve practical programming problems, fostering a deeper understanding of Java and OOP.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following key components:

### **Cell00: Fundamentals of Java**

Contains 15 foundational exercises designed to teach basic Java concepts, including:

- Syntax and control structures
- Data types and variables
- Functions and error handling

### **Cell01: Threads and Processes**

Explores intermediate topics such as multithreading and process management. Includes:

- Exercises on thread creation and synchronization
- Practical challenges involving concurrent programming
- A **final project**: The Dining Philosophers Problem, a classic concurrency problem that demonstrates synchronization techniques and deadlock prevention.

### **U-Tad Folder**
Materials and exercises from the Object-Oriented Programming course in the Double Degree in Software Engineering and Mathematics program at U-Tad.

### **Nebrija Folder**
Includes practical assignments and materials from the Programming courses in the Application Development degree program at the University of Nebrija.
