# Java Projects CE
In this repository are the projects for the subjects, Object-oriented programming and data structures taken in the 2022-2023 academic year when I started studying computer engineering at another center (Prior to transferring to my current double degree).
The language used in all projects is Java, where I studied the object-oriented model and data structures such as queue, list, doubly linked list...
# Distribution
The repository consists in each subject of 2 continuous evaluation activities (CEA) used as a reflection of the knowledge acquired by the student during the subject (as a final project) that encompassed the topics 1 - 5 and 6 - 10, in addition They include two self-learning (AA) activities that functioned as a review of the content to a lesser extent.
Currently I have only been able to rescue 2 pristine projects, the rest are still under review.

# Extra 
With these subjects I was introduced to the Java language from scratch and they were really good for me to understand data structures and the object-oriented model that today has been taught to me again at my university. 
It's a really important paradigm so enjoy :)
